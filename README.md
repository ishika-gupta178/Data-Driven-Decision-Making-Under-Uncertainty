# Data-Driven-Decision-Making-Under-Uncertainty

Conducted a data-driven analysis using Microsoft Excel for Acme Company to evaluate whether to proceed with or abandon the development of a new product, using Expected Monetary Value (EMV) as the key performance indicator (KPI). 

Built a decision tree model with PrecisionTree to visualize potential outcomes, probabilities, and decision paths on Excel.

Performed a What-if analysis to assess the impact of varying fixed development costs ($1M to $5M) on EMV, and visualized results through Excel charts and strategy graphs. 

Developed a data-driven strategy that identified fixed development cost thresholds ($1M to $4M) where continuing development and marketing would maximize the Expected Monetary Value (EMV).
